//Title// processing/arduino etch-n-sketch

This repositiory if for the SVA MFA IxD Dept final of Jennings Hanna and Deborah Koo.

The script works with a ardruino that has two potentiometers and a button. The potes create a etch-N-sketch and the button changes the type of drawing program.

Take, Have, re-Use, please...

Cheers from IxD MFA SVA NYC, yo!
